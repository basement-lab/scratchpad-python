# Scratchpad: Python

### Getting Started

1) Start the environment up. From the project ROOT run `$ source bin/activate`

2) Execute the index script with `$ python bootstrap.py`

n) Exit the environment with `$ deactivate`

### Keep In Mind

Things like packages _should be_ installed using `pip` from an "Active" environment.

`shift + command + b` will execute the active file in the VS Code editor.

`docker-compose up -d --remove-orphans` this will run our docker-compose file which initiates and runs the image(s).
